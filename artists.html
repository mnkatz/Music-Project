                <h2>The Artist Perspective</h2>
                <p class="lead">The first relevant social group is artists. </P>
                <p class="lead">Fundamentally, artists want two things in return for distribution of music: exposure and money. Artists’ desires speak to the original goal of Copyright Law - to protect the work of artists in the hope that they will be able to recoup the financial fruits of their labor. However, the evolution of listening technologies has not been kind to their coffers. Vinyls, cassettes, and CDs forced people to acquire physical copies in order to listen to music. Thus, artists and record companies could set a fixed price on the value of their works. However, the rise of peer-to-peer (P2P) piracy with the rise of MP3s in the early 2000s began to take a toll on the bottom line. Emerging to remedy this challenge but still provide greater accessibility to music, streaming services like Rhapsody and Pandora acquired a growing user base.</p>

                <p class ="lead">However, artists have not been wholly satisfied with streaming services, the most of prominent of which in the past few years has been Spotify. While the free tier of Spotify and other streaming services like Pandora has significantly decreased instances of piracy across countries, many artists oppose Spotify, arguing that it does not properly compensate them for their work and for their streams. However, other artists support Spotify, claiming it to be better than piracy and believing that it gives them greater exposure.</p>

            <div class="clients-area center wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>Artists Divided</h2>
                <p class="lead">The rise of these streaming services has created a schism between different “tiers” of artists, the most notable of which are independent artists and major label artists. Major label artists on the whole do not need to worry about exposure, and care mostly about being compensated for their work. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that record companies take large cuts of their revenue. Indie artists also have an interest in being compensated for their work, but need to balance their with their intention of gaining greater exposure. While the perspectives about music streaming services vary across both major label and independent artists, the priorities between the two groups of artists is nonetheless different.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="get-started center wow fadeInDown">
                <h2>How Spotify and Tidal Fit into the Artist Narrative</h2>
                <p class="lead">Access to music through streaming services reduced piracy, but Spotify did not satisfy all artists. Criticism emerged that Spotify did not fairly compensate artists, leading Thom Yorke to take off some of his catalogue and Taylor Swift to take her entire catalogue off of Spotify. In March 2014, a band called Vulfpeck released an entirely album called Sleepify, and said that if their fans streamed the album so much that it reached $20,000 in streaming royalties, they would put on a free tour. While they ended up making the 20k, Spotify removed the album and said it violated unspecified terms. The debate between artists and Spotify has continued since.</p>
                <p class="lead">However, in early 2015, Jay-Z acquired a music streaming service which he renamed Tidal. Tidal advertised better artist compensation, and had an online launch event during which many prominent artists went on stage and proclaimed all artists “co-owners” of Tidal. However, as “mindie” (mainstream indie) artists like Ben Gibbard and Lily Allen described, Tidal made a mistake by placing only rich artists on stage during their debut event. Additionally, Tidal only accommodates listeners who can afford to pay for music streaming, excluding the patronage of those who do not have the means to pay for such a service.</p>
                <p class="lead">We will have to see how the competition between Spotify and Tidal, along with the emergence of other technologies, plays out. Additionally, Apple acquired Beats, and looks to start another paid service.</p>
